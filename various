LIVER

#Decompensated liver cirrhosis
* Compensated => no complications
* Decompensated => implications (eg. Jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage, ascites, SBP, hepatorenal syndrome, HCC).
* Consider ceftriaxone prophylaxis if SBP or variceal bleeding
* Paracentesis: cell count, albumin, total protein, culture


#Hepatorenal syndrome
* Hold Lasix 40mg and sprinolactone 100mg
* Midodrine (max 15mg PO TID)
* Octreotide 100-200ug subQ TID
* Albumin 1g/kg (max 100g) on day of presentation, followed by 20-60g albumin daily


#Cirrhosis and SBP
Given albumin if SBP with at least one of the following: serum > 1mg/dL, BUN > 30mg/dL, Tbili > 4mg/dL 
* Albumin 25% 1.5g/kg within 6-hours of detection (day 1) and 1g/kg on day 3


#Paracentesis studies
AASLD 2021 - 
https://journals.lww.com/hep/fulltext/2021/08000/diagnosis,_evaluation,_and_management_of_ascites,.34.aspx

First episode of ascites:
* Cell count, albumin, total protein, culture
* Only if secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected: glucose, LDH
* Only when other causes of ascites (other than cirrhosis) is suspected: cytology
* Only when pancreatic origin of ascites is suspected: amylase

Recurrent ascites:
* Cell count, culture
* SAAG: No
* Protein: only when a primary prophylaxis of SBP is clinically indicated, or a secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected.


#Large volume paracentesis (>5 L fluid removed) - AASLD 2021
* Give 6-8g albumin per L fluid removed (eg. For 5L removed, give 40g albumin)
